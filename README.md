# TreeNet3D
TreeNet3D is the first large-scale, multi-type synthetic tree model dataset. The dataset comprises 13,000 models of ten common tree species: camphor tree, small-leaved olive,  agarwood, flooded gum, lemon tree, lombardy poplar ,tibetan cherry, flamboyant tree, fir tree and ajang olive, with each species represented by 1,300 samples. Each tree model offers a 3D point cloud with hierarchical structure and precise parameters, along with information on tree skeletons and volume.  The 3D point cloud is divided into original and noise-added variants, with a distinct separation structure for branches and leaves.  Each branch is differentiated and assigned a branch number attribute based on its sequence.  The tree skeleton abstracts the tree branches into node information, with each skeleton node containing hierarchical relationships and accurate tree radius information.
